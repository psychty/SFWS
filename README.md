## Smokefree West Sussex Alliance Action Plan 2019-2022 SFWS TC Plan

This project is to visualise the 2019-2022 Smoke Free West Sussex Tobacco Control Plan.

The action plan is expected to be reviewed every quarter and as actions are completed and new ones are established, the plan will change.

New features will be added frequently.

The 2019-22 Smokefree West Sussex Tobacco Control Strategy actions are outlined below. These are a collection of actions agreed by members of the Smokefree West Sussex Partnership to take forward the tobacco control agenda in the county. Actions are coloured by the Department of Health's 2008 10 high impact changes to achieve tobacco control.

You can filter the actions by the time frame (short to long term) or by the level at which the action is expected to operate within (individual/community/or place). To learn more about an action, click on the box. You can also search for keywords such as 'e-cigarettes' or 'maternity' to find relevant actions.
