          <h1>Actions</h1>
          <p>The 2019-22 Smokefree West Sussex Tobacco Control Strategy actions are outlined below. These are a collection of actions agreed by members of the Smokefree West Sussex Partnership to take forward the tobacco control agenda in the county. Actions are coloured by the Department of Health's 2008 10 high impact changes to achieve tobacco control.</p>
          <h3>This action plan has been updated in January 2020 to include partner updates.</h3>
          <p>You can filter the actions by the time frame (short to long term), by relevant partners/stakeholders, or by the level at which the action is expected to operate within (individual/community/or environment). To learn more about an action, hover over each box.</p>
          <p>The 2019-22 Smokefree West Sussex Tobacco Control Strategy document can be found <a href="https://ws-jsna.netlify.com/assets/core/Smokefree%20West%20Sussex%20Tobacco%20Control%20Strategy%20Short%202019-22%20final.pdf">here</a>.</p>
          <p>Hover over an action (tile) to see more information, including the progress made to date and what we think success looks like. The actions range from short term to long term and some are ongoing and as such, our progress rating does not reflect whether the task is complete but rather how we thinkg we are doing giving how far we are into the lifecourse of the overall strategy. The colour of the border therefore denotes whether we think this is on target to be achieved (<font color = "#3ECC26"><b>green</b></font>), almost there (<font color = "#E7AF27"><b>amber</b></font>), needs some work (<font color = "#CC2629"><b>red</b></font>) or where progress is unknown (grey).</p>

<p></p><h3>January update: </h3><p>Our maternity in house stop smoking service plans to go live mid Jan 2020 (pending wscc legal and contractual sign off). Huge thanks to WSCC for supporting this proof of concept model. I will be training our maternity support workers on the 18th Dec in appreciative inquiry (so that they are skilled in having difficult conversations) and they will also be completing the NCSCT e-learning at practitioner level. All the PGDs have passed successfully through the Trust‚Äôs medicines management committee, which means our maternity support workers will be able to give NRT as part of this new service (I think this is an England first but would need to check!). I really do believe this service will better support women to quit and remain smoke free as well as continue to signpost other family members to the existing stop smoking services. We will be running the proof of concept for 6 months initially and will closely monitor and evaluate to inform future commissioning.</p>
